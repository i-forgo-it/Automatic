# Automatic
Automatic is a simple bash script made to automate usefull tools for recon and content discovery 

# how it works 
you first answer the questions to run the tools ![image](https://github.com/i-forgo-it/Automatic/assets/163911891/34891b27-e0e2-4279-a90f-02c847a2dd5a)

then it goes through subfinder => puredns => httpx then go or waybackurls or both then it looks for patterns so you can use them to feed them to the tools and then it runs the tools if you said yes, and  then it goes through nuclei and to    end everything it takes a nice screenshot of everysubdomain.

in the end you have your files ready ![image](https://github.com/i-forgo-it/Automatic/assets/163911891/87d699e7-70d5-43c7-87da-be7b005cf8b2)

# Small note 
I wanted to make a script that automates some of my recon and after finishing why not share it on github :). Keep in mind this is a simple script and I am not a god so sorry if you get erros but you should not (i hope).
I will certainly be looking to improve this script in the future so if you guys want to improve it or have suggestions or you get some erros don't hesitate !!

# how to use
First you need to download all the tools that are used in the script nuclei,subfinder,httpx,gf,Haylxon,puredns,waybackurls or gau,(sqlmap,dalfox,corsy.py)those between brackets are optional.
Note, if you have an error it may because of the tools that are not updated or properly  set up for example gf with the patters and stuff.

Download the script 

Then you need to change the path in the script of the hxn to your right browser and where is your httpx on your machine and the path to corsy.py if you have installed it.
